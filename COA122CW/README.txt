Hi Firat,

Here are a list of things that I like and could improve
as well as notes on some parts of my code.

Things I like about my code:
- I like how my GUI looks and small features I added like dropdown menus and
displaying game information in a table
- I like the structure of my code

Thinks I could have improved:
- I could have explored more criterias for inventory pruning
- I could have explored a different way to do my GUI
- I could have added additional games into my text file in a way
that would make the programming and usability easier.

Notes:
- The load_feedback() function from the feedbackManager module didn't work
so I read the feedback information myself
- I have used pandas for my GUI to display a table in my GUI
